# 🎟️ Event Booking Application

**CS5610 – Web Development**  

---

## 📌 About the Project

The **Event Booking App** is a full-stack web platform that makes discovering and booking local events easy and enjoyable. Users can browse upcoming shows, check out venue maps, and securely book tickets — all in one place.

This as a SaaS-style application using **React** for the front end, **Node.js + Prisma** for the backend, and **JWT-based authentication with cookies** to keep user sessions secure.

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do

- 🔍 Browse a list of upcoming events
- 📍 View detailed event info + Google Maps venue integration
- 📝 Register and log in securely
- 🎟️ Book tickets to events you're excited about
- 📄 Manage your bookings (update or cancel)
- 🔐 Stay protected with cookie-based authentication

---

## 🧠 How It Works 

- React handles all the routing and views (landing, login, event detail, etc.)
- Prisma connects the backend to a PostgreSQL database
- Secure routes are protected using JWTs stored in **HTTP-only cookies**
- Google Maps API shows venue locations on event pages
- Bookings and events are linked via database relationships
